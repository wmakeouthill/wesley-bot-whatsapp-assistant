- Core stack: **Python** (backend, data, predictive algorithms) and **React 19 + Vite** (frontend)
- Cloud infrastructure: **AWS** and **Google Cloud**
- CI/CD and deploy: **GitHub Actions**, **Vercel**, **Docker Compose**

## Experience at the Company

### Fullstack Developer

*Period: February 2026 - Present | Remote*

#### Infrastructure and DevOps

- Configured environments on **AWS** and **Google Cloud**
- Application deploy; CI/CD pipelines on **GitHub Actions**
- Deploy on **Vercel** for frontend and applications
- Configured **Docker Compose** for container orchestration
- Full development cycle involvement on 2 projects for large enterprises

#### Predictive Algorithms and AI

- Fixed and evolved predictive algorithm with **Prophet** (Python) for time series
- New predictive algorithm features for:
  - **Transfer** recommendations
  - **Purchase** recommendations
  - **Substitute** recommendations based on demand and predictions
- Python as main language for models and data

#### Full-Stack Development

- **Backend:** Python for APIs, data processing, and predictive models
